# RPC Keys – Pricing & Costs

All Conduit organisations are on the *Free Plan* by default. You can upgrade to our *Pro Plan* in a few clicks or contact sales for our Enterprise Plan.

**Note:** Rollup customers who have deployed a mainnet get the *RPC Key Pro Plan* for free.

### Plans

#### Free Plan

- 400M Compute Units/month
- 1 key

#### Pro Plan

- Included free with mainnet deployments
- Otherwise $50/month
- 1B Compute Units/month
    - Additional usage costs $0.10/1M CUs
- 10 keys
- Basic support

#### Enterprise Plan

- Custom pricing

    - Additional usage costs $0.10/1M CUs
- Unlimited keys

### Autoscaling

Paid plans autoscale at $0.10/1M CUs once the base CU limit has been reached. e.g. When on the Pro Plan, once your org has consumed the 1B CU base limit included in your plan, every additional 1M CUs will cost $0.10. You can add a spend limit in settings, which allows you to control the maximum amount that can be spent each month.
