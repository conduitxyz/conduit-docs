# Get Sepolia ETH

To get Sepolia (testnet) ETH on your chain, you'll need to acquire some from a faucet then bridge them over.

## Steps

<Steps>

### Choose a faucet

First, head to your rollup's dashboard in the [Conduit app](https://app.conduit.xyz/). On the right sidebar of the dashboard below the Tracer we have a built-in faucet for Sepolia ETH.

Or, head to the public [Conduit Faucet](https://faucet.conduit.xyz) _(requires GitHub sign in)_ directly to get Sepolia ETH.

If you need more Sepolia ETH, here are some other recommended faucets:

- [Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) _(requires Privy sign in)_

### Receive funds

Enter your wallet address and begin receiving funds from your chosen faucet(s).

### Go to the Conduit app

Once received, head to your deployment dashboard in the [Conduit app](https://app.conduit.xyz/).

### Connect to your network

Add your chain to your wallet's list of networks and ensure it's selected.

### Bridge your Sepolia ETH

Head to your chain's bridge and move your Sepolia ETH from the Ethereum Sepolia network to your new chain.

If you haven't created a bridge yet, [follow this guide](https://docs.conduit.xyz/guides/bridge-ui).
