## Native USDC Bridge

This integration follows Circleâ€™s specification and process for deploying bridged USDC onto your rollup, and can be upgraded into native USDC at a later date.

## Bridging Using the Standard

Once installed, you should no longer bridge USDC using the standard bridge. Instead, use the deployed addresses.
If you are using SuperBridge for your bridge UI, contact them to automatically add your USDC bridge to their UI.
If you are using a different provier for the bridge UI, ask them, otherwise you risk fragmenting your liquidity between two bridged versions of USDC.

## Bridging Via the CLI

Alternatively, you can bridge USDC using `cast` as follows:

### Optimism

On the settlement layer, send the following transactions to bridge USDC to your rollup:

```bash
# first approve USDC
cast send $L1_USDC_ADDRESS "approve(address,uint256)" $L1_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS $AMOUNT --rpc-url $SETTLEMENT_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# then bridge USDC
cast send $L1_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address,uint256,uint32)" $(cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY) $AMOUNT 100000 --rpc-url $SETTLEMENT_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

After a few minutes, your deposit should be processsed and available on your rollup.
To withdraw, you can send these transactions to your rollup:

```bash
# first approve USDC
cast send $L2_USDC_ADDRESS "approve(address,uint256)" $L2_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS $AMOUNT --rpc-url $ROLLUP_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# then withdraw USDC
cast send $L2_USDC_BRIDGE_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address,uint256,uint32)" $(cast wallet address $PRIVATE_KEY) $AMOUNT 100000 --rpc-url $ROLLUP_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
